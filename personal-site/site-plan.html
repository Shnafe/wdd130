      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Pitch:</p>
      <p>Do you ever feel like you aren`t progressing in 
        life? I have experienced that same feeling, 
        which is why I decided to make “The Quest Board.”
        “The Quest Board” works just like a video game 
        where you do tasks which give you XP when 
        completed. My goal is to get you to start 
        achieving your goals by incentivizing them with 
        the same system that makes video games so 
        rewarding to our brains: XP and Leveling. 
        You can write your own tasks (or quests) and put 
        them on the board, or if you are having trouble 
        thinking of goals you would like to achieve, we 
        have some basic ones already there for you. All 
        you need to do is accept them and they will be 
        added to your board.</p>
      <p>THIS IS THE WEBSITE FOR THE APP. IT HAS INFO AND
        FAQs ON THE APP. IT ALSO HAS A SUPPORT PAGE. IT
        TALKS ABOUT ANY UPCOMING UPDATES.</p>

      <h2>APP INFO | Home Page</h2>
      <p>This page will contain information on the app
        including any recently added features. It will also
        contain any additional future update info. This is
        where people will go when they have questions or
        concerns about the recent updates to the app. This
        page will also contain screenshots and videos of the
        app being used.
      </p>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <p>This page will contain any frequently asked
        questions so people can quickly and easily find
        answers to their basic questions. If a user has a
        more complex question and cannot find the answer on
        the FAQs, they should check out the support page.
      </p>

      <h2>Support</h2>
      <p>This page is for users who have questions that go 
        beyond the FAQs. This is also where users can request
        support if anything isn't working as it should. </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience is mostly people who don't get out 
        much, and nerds who have trouble making and 
        keeping goals. We all know that nerds rule the world, 
        but only the nerds who actually make and accomplish goals.</p>  <!-- change this -->

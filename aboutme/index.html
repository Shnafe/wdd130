    <h3>Josh</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Josh! I'm a computer science major. I love to learn new languages. I currently know two and I'm learning a third. The two that I know are English, obviously, and Spanish. I am currently also learning Portuguese. I also love to hang out with friends and play games, be it board games or video games! I have recently gotten into two sports: one is Pickleball and the other is Judo (it's a type of Martial Art)</p>
    <p>My favorite video games are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</li>
        <li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</li>
        <li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
        <li>Portal 2</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all of my life. My mother is a convert from Judaism. I got back from a Spanish speaking mission last year in Oregon. Yes, I was a COVID missionary!</p>
